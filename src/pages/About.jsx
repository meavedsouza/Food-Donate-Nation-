        <h2>Our Purpose</h2>
        <p>
          The world is divided into two realities — one with surplus food,
          and another where people sleep hungry. Our mission is simple:
          ensure that excess food reaches those who need it instead of being wasted.
        </p>

        <p>
          Whether it’s food from homes, hostels, restaurants, or events,
          our platform enables quick and responsible donations with minimal effort.
        </p>

        <h2>Our Vision</h2>
        <p>
          We aim to create a sustainable, community-driven network where
          individuals, NGOs, and volunteers work together to fight hunger
          and reduce food waste.
